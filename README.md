# About this app

This is a React-based online store! The actual company is fictive, as you will rapidly guess.
As the user shops and thus ads acres to purchase on different moons, the cart is updated accordingly. 
Each Moon has its own information page.
Each page provides useful common functions associated with the page's purpose (More info, Add To Cart, Delete Item, Clear Cart, Checkout, Add more Acres, Back To Shop etc.).

# Under the hood

This app was created with React. Building an online store like so was a great way to get better at using basic hooks like useState and useEffect and familiarize myself with routing in React.

Also, I decided to style my project with TailwindCSS, a useful tool to accelerate the styling process. 

Finally, I implemented testing as part of the project, focusing on the Shop and Cart components. 
It proved to be one of the trickiest aspect of the project as the protocol to mock functions testing for the right values to be displayed following certain events wasn't totally obvious at first.
The app is not tested at 100%, so attaining complete testing would be a great future improvement.
